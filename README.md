# SCD-Implementation-using-IICS
In this project I am working with Superstore Dataset. This is a POC project in which i would be using snowflake as a warehouse and IICS as ETL tool.

Please Read the Documentation for a deep dive into the project.

I developed this project as POC for an internal project. Using Informatica Cloud Data Integration (IICS), I transformed the initial dataset into a fact table and two dimension tables.I then implemented Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) to track data changes (inserts and updates) with separate flags. The results were visualized in Power BI for enhanced historical analysis.

Here is a quick demonstration of how it works
